On development GNU CLI powered by .NET, based on zsh.

Follow the steps above to install this program with install.sh :
1. echo "$(wget -O- https://pyenv.run)" Check the script and make sure everything is normal and safe.
2. sh -c "$(wget -O- https://pyenv.run)" Now that we are sure everything is safe, run the script.
3. To use this program you must install the .NET runtime using sudo. 
I dont want to include a sudo command on the installer so you must do it by yourself.

       sudo apt-get update && \
         sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-6.0
